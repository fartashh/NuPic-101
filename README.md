# NuPic 101

Documenting my journey learning HTM and NuPic

### Getting Started

**Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM)** is a theory of intelligence that can be implemented in most computer programming languages. Below are descriptions of several HTM implementations currently active within our community. For detailed descriptions of HTM algorithms, see our living text, Biological and Machine Intelligence. It contains pseudocode for both the spatial pooling and temporal memory algorithms (PDFs).

**NuPIC**, or the Numenta Platform for Intelligent Computing, is an HTM implementation created by Numenta and open-sourced in June 2013. This codebase is the original HTM codebase, and is architected in a way that allows algorithmic experimentation in Python, but more performant versions of HTM algorithms in C++.

### Prerequisites

Get yourself familiar with NuPic and HTM theory

### Installing

 - Create python 2.7 virtual env
 ```
 >>> virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 venv    
```
 - install requirements
 ```
 (venv) >>> pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```
